visiting the opera
o the pelican so smoothly doth he crest a wind god
this is a pilot puzzle to get you started have fun
o romeo o romeo wherefore art thou romeo
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs
you must be the change you wish to see in the world
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
all that glitters is not gold
keep your friends close but your enemies closer
speak softly and carry a big stick
the love of money is the root of all evil
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
an old warhorse in the stable still longs to gallop a thousand miles
